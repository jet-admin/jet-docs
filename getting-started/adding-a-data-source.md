# Connecting your resources

Jet Admin integrates with most data sources, such as PostgreSQL, internal APIs, Stripe, Firebase, SQLite, etc. Check out our continuously updating list of all supported resources here. 

You can add different resources simultaneously either on the welcome page that will pop up after you sign up or later on from Settings.

### 1.1 Adding a resource

Once you've signed up, created a project, and choose 'Add a resource' you can see block with available resources:
