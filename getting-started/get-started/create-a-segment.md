# Create a Segment

In Jet Admin you can add filters and segments to your collections to simplify data management.

Use segments, when you need to quickly find and navigate through the same filtered data **on a regular basis.** For example, we're creating segments here to identify 3 order's statuses: _Preorder, Takeaway and Booking_. 

To create a simple segment, apply a filter or a set of filters by pushing the Filter button and then click the disk icon next to the filter\(s\) tag.

Then type in the name of a new segment and click "Add Segment".

### 

We created segments with _order types_ in the _Orders_ collection. To view segments of a specific collection, click on the arrow next to the collection's header **\(1\)** or unfold this collection in the navigation bar **\(2\)**.
