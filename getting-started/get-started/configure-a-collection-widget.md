# Configure a collection widget

Collection Widgets are simply different layout types for displaying your collection data in the most suitable way.  For instance, it might be a good idea to visualize collections that include a location field in the form of a map.

_Remember that you can set up multiple widgets for one collection and switch from one to another by clicking on their icons at the top of the screen._
