# Setup Guide

Welcome to your new Admin Panel! You've successfully installed Jet Admin, but where do you go from here? To make sure you get the best out of our features, we've created a Setup Guide.

When you log into your admin panel, click the **? icon** in the left menu bar and select Setup Guide. You'll be taken to a new window with the instructions.
