# Change icons and titles of your collections

Jet Admin can automatically generate a proper icon for the most common types of collections, such as _users_, _orders_, _payments_, etc.â€Œ

However, you can change both icons and titles of your collections at any time. To do that, enter the [Visual Builder](../../user-guide/visual-builder.md) mode and select the Menu. Click on the cog icon to the right of a collection you'd like to edit and start customizing.
