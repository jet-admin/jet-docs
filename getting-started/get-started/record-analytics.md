# Record Analytics

Having overall KPIs displayed on your dashboard is great, but sometimes you might need to get analytics on a specific user, item, etc. You can do that by adding a chart right inside a record.

These charts are created the same way you would do it in the dashboard tab. Let's add a counter chart to count the sum of transactions for a specific car model. 

1. To create a new chart, enter the Visual Builder mode from a record to which you would like to add the chart. Then, choose an suitable chart widget from the menu on the right.

2. Once you drag and dropped a chart on your dashboard, you would have to build a query to specify this chart's parameters. 

1. Type in the name of a chart 
2. Select a widget \(in case you'd like to change it\)
3. Select a collection that will be a data source
4. Apply filters to disctinct the needed data
5. Choose aggregation function: 

* Count
* Sum
* Min
* Max
* Avg

6. If you would like to add several charts, press '+ Add more':

7. For each chart you can set legend and color:

8. Select fields using 'Group by'.

Once you saved the chart, it will appear right in a Record view. Remember that you can edit, delete, recize, or relocate the chart at any moment.
