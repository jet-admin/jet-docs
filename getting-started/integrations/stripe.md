## 3. Set up collections and actions

Once you've added Stripe to Jet Admin, you'll be able to see your 'Collections' or the groupings of data we pulled from your resource, such as Invoices, Subscriptions, Cards, Transactions, Refunds, etc.

Select collections that you would like to use in Jet Admin:

To quickly set up actions \(buttons that will trigger actions through an API call\) to be performed on your payments data, specify collections  and grant permissions for each individual action:

## 4. Predefined interface

We prepared customizable templates of how you can visualize your data in Jet Admin. You can either employ the templates as they are or use them as a starting idea for your unique tools.
