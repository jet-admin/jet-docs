# How it works

**Jet Admin** is a SaaS frontend application hosted on **Jet Admin** side that works in your browser. It connects to your project SQL database through open source **Jet Bridge** backend application which you install on your side. So Integrating **Jet Admin** with your project requires installing only one component - **Jet Bridge**. Here how it should look like after installation:

**Your Web App**

Any of your applications which works with your **Database**. **Jet Admin** does not interact with it directly.

**Your Database**

Your database **Jet Admin** has no direct access to.

**Jet Bridge App**

An open source application installed on your server's side and connected to your database. It automatically generates REST API based on your database structure. **Jet Interface** works with **Database** through **Jet Bridge**.

**Jet Interface**

Web application accessible from any browser. Maintaining and updating of this web application is on **Jet Admin** team side. Your application data is transmitted directly from **Jet Bridge** to **Jet Interface** in your browser and remain invisible for the **Jet Admin** service.

### Data Privacy

The main advantage of Jet Adminâ€™s architecture is that absolutely no data transits or crosses our servers. The user accesses application data directly from the client and Jet Admin is just deployed as a service to display and interact with the data. 

With Jet Admin, your data are transferred directly from your application to your browser while remaining invisible to our servers.

### User Authentication

When user logs in **Jet Admin** he receives **User Token** generated by **api.jetadmin.io**. Jet Admin **UI settings** are stored on the **api.jetadmin.io** and your **Project Data** is stored on **Your Web App** server. 

So the user browser can send the following requests:

* to get or update **UI settings** user browser sends requests to **api.jetadmin.io** and passes **HTTP Authorization Header** containing **User Token**. Because **api.jetadmin.io** is an issuer of this token - it can verify it.
* to get or update **Project Data** user browser sends requests to **Jet Bridge App** \(open source\) installed on **Your Server** and passes the same **HTTP Authorization Header** containing **User Token**. **Jet Bridge App** performs requests to [https://api.jetadmin.io/api/project\_auth/](http://api.jetadmin.io/api/project_auth/) endpoint and passes received **User Token** to verify if its valid and if user has enough permissions. Also **Jet Bridge App** sends its **Project Token** to all api.jetadmin.io endpoints which is described below.

### Jet Bridge Authentication

In order for **Jet Bridge App** be able to communicate with **api.jetadmin.io** it obtains its unique **Project Token** which will be used to authenticate all requests to **api.jetadmin.io**. This token is generated by making call to **api.jetadmin.io** once on **Jet Bridge App** install and saved in **Your Database**.
