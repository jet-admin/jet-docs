#### Requirements

* **Python** 2.7 or 3.4+
* **PIP,** a package manager for Python packages
* Any of the following **SQL Databases**:
  * PostgreSQL 
  * MySQL 
  * SQLite 
  * Oracle 
  * Microsoft SQL Server 
* A **localhost** or **web server** with an external IP address.

#### Installation

1. Follow this guide to create a project: [https://app.jetadmin.io/projects/create](https://app.jetadmin.io/projects/create)
2. Install **Python** 2.7 or 3.4+ \(comes with **pip\)** [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
3. Install **jet\_bridge** package using **pip** or update it from the command line as follows:

```bash
pip install jet_bridge -U# or for Python 3pip3 install jet_bridge -U
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For **Windows** you need to specify **pip** full path and run command this way \(**pip** is stored in **Scripts** folder inside **Python**, path may be different in your case\):  
_C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python37-32\Scripts\pip.exe install jet\_bridge -U_
{% endhint %}

4. Install an appropriate database adapter and libraries

```bash
# for PostgreSQLpip install psycopg2# for PostgreSQL + PosGISpip install GeoAlchemy2==0.6.2pip install Shapely==1.6.4# for MySQLpip install mysqlclient# for MSSQLpip install pyodbc
```

{% hint style="info" %}
For **Windows** and **MySQL** you may also need to install **Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2017:**  
[https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads](https://support.microsoft.com/ru-ru/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads)
{% endhint %}

5. Run **Jet Bridge** from the command line as shown below:

```bash
PROJECT=hi_16 TOKEN=20a05f49-52c9-4015-ab72-9332dc0c8732 jet_bridge
```

Note: This command will create a config file, when you run it for the first time.  
If you already have a config file, you should edit it and set options:

```text
JET_PROJECT = 'hi_16'
JET_TOKEN = '20a05f49-52c9-4015-ab72-9332dc0c8732'
```

6. After filling all required options, a config file will be generated. Now you can run Jet Bridge by executing this command once again:

```text
jet_bridge
```

7. Finish your project installation by opening in your browser \(normally it should open automatically\): [**http://localhost:8888/api/register/**](http://localhost:8888/api/register/) where **localhost** is your **Jet Bridge** HOST and **8888** is its PORT. If you want to run Jet Bridge on different host/port you can configure it \(read more at [Configuration](https://docs.jetadmin.io/getting-started/configuration) page\).

{% hint style="info" %}
If you don't have **Jet** account yet, you will be asked to create one and sign in with the existing account.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
After registering your project, you will be redirected to your project and can start working with **Jet Admin.**
