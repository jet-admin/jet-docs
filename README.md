# Jet Admin

## What is Jet Admin

Jet Admin is a no-code internal tool builder. The simple drag-and-drop interface enables anyone to create the tools they need to manage daily operations, like tracking orders, resolving issues, and monitoring payments.

## How it works

1. **Connect data sources**                                                                                                         Connect Jet Admin to your data sources, such as PostgreSQL, Stripe, Twilio, and 10+ others. 
2. **Start browsing**                                                                                                         In the auto-generated app, youâ€™ll be able to view your data, perform operations, and apply filters and segments.   

               

3. **Customize the interface**                                                                                                                   Drag and drop widgets in your interface to assemble internal tools. Pull in and combine data from different resources and set up actions.

               

4. **Set up actions**                                                                                  Write data to your data sources with predefined actions like making a refund or blocking a user. 
5. **Create workflows**                                                                                                                           ****Select triggers and link them with one or a series of actions. 

               

6. **Collaborate**                                                                                                                                Invite your team members and set up permissions. Assign tasks, leave notes, and chat with the team directly through Jet.

_This is a complete remake of our popular_ [_Django Jet_](https://github.com/geex-arts/django-jet) _admin interface._

## Getting started

When you connect your resources to Jet Admin, your data will be rendered similarly to how it is stored in database. 

In Jet Admin, collections represent tables in a database. Each **collection** is composed of **records**, **fields**, and **actions**. 

Learn more about **data structure** in Jet Admin:

{% page-ref page="user-guide/collection/" %}

{% page-ref page="user-guide/records.md" %}

{% page-ref page="user-guide/field/" %}

{% page-ref page="user-guide/actions/" %}

To quickly browse through your data, you can apply **filters** and create **segments**.

Learn more about filters and segments here:

{% page-ref page="user-guide/filter.md" %}

{% page-ref page="user-guide/segment.md" %}
