We have only a few simple guidelines:

* Be polite and kind to other members
* Use the search bar to see if your topic has been discussed before
* Check out the community’s different [categories](https://community.jetadmin.io/)
* When posting questions, try to be clear and concise and write descriptive titles. If you need help with many different things, try posting them as separate topics.
* Where possible, provide links \(e.g. to your app\), screenshots or even videos that help explain the point you are trying to make
* Please be aware that everything you post in the forums is public
* If you have questions that others could benefit from – try to post publicly and not privately message other members. Some of our experts and staff get a lot of DMs – bear in mind that there are many other people in the forum that may be able to help you.
