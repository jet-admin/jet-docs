Using an efficient internal tool is great, but using it collaboratively is even more powerful. This is why we've laid the foundations of what will grow to be an essential tool of your day-to-day work.

## Users And Teams

We give you the ability to invite users to your project and create teams with different access levels to the project to make it more convenient for you to work in Jet Admin.

## User Activities

As your team grows, it is very difficult to keep track of all changes in the project, so we have created the ability to track user activity for your convenience.
