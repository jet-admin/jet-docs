As your team grows, it is very difficult to keep track of all changes in the project, so we have created the ability to track any activities \(delete, edit, create, etc\) did by specific users. 

To track user activity, simply click the **Activity Log** icon on the menu.

You can track the time and type of activity. You can also see which user did the changes in the project.
