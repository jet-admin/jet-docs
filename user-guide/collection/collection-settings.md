## Accessing Collection settings

There are two places where you can configure settings for your collections:

### A collection view in the Visual Builder mode

## Managing Collection setting

In the new window, you can set up General settings, such as your collection's name, default sorting, default storing ordering, display field, and primary key field. You can also configure the visibility settings for your collection by checking or unchecking the Hidden box at the bottom of the window.

## Collection permissions

You can give full access to a certain user or team to view and edit your collections, make them read-only, etc.
