# Collection Widgets

## **What are Collection Widgets?**

Collection Widgets are simply different layout types for displaying your collection data in the most appropriate way.  

To change or add a collection widget for your collection, enter the customization mode and choose a layout type from the menu bar on the right. 

Here are the five collection widgets you can find in Jet Admin:

## Table 

When you deploy Jet Admin, all data from your database will be rendered in a Table view by default. You can later switch to a different collection widget in the customization mode or leave it just like that.

What's more, you can edit any column in your table in a collection view by simply hovering on it and clicking the pen icon instead of entering the Visual Builder mode.

## Kanban

A kanban board is often used to simplify and visualize complex processes, e.g. user onboarding or shipping.

## Map 

The map widget allows you to see locations of your items or team members \(e.g. couriers\). For instance, you can track your delivery team and vehicles' location.

To change a field that is set up as your "location field", enter the customization mode and click on the cog icon next to "Map" in the menu bar on the right.

The calendar widget is great for sorting your data by date, e.g. managing appointments and meetings.

## Create custom widget

In case you haven't found an appropriate widget for rendering your data from our pre-existed ones, we created the Flex View feature that allows you to create and integrate your own widget into Jet.
