Integrate our [**Jet Bridge**](https://app.gitbook.com/@jetadmin/s/doc/~/drafts/-M9TnCmHUbdvDWPtOccj/jet-bridge-deployment/install) ****plugin with Python installation. You can place it behind your VPN, in your own VPC, and works locally. We wonâ€™t get access to your data, however, you will still receive updates normally.

### Requirements:

* Python 2.7 or 3.4+
* **pip** - package manager for Python
* Any of the following SQL Databases:
  * PostgreSQL
  * MySQL
  * SQLite
  * Oracle
  * Microsoft SQL Server
  * Firebird
  * Sybase
* **localhost** or **web server** with an external IP

### Installation

1. [Install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 2.7 or 3.4+ \(comes with **pip**\).

2. Install jet\_bridge package using **pip** or update it from the command line as follows:

```bash
pip install jet_bridge -U
# or for Python 3
pip3 install jet_bridge -U
```

3. Install an appropriate database adapter and libraries:

```bash
# for PostgreSQL
pip install psycopg2

# for PostgreSQL + PosGIS
pip install GeoAlchemy2==0.6.2
pip install Shapely==1.6.4

# for MySQL
pip install mysqlclient

# for MSSQL
pip install pyodbc
```

 4. Run Jet Bridge from the command line as shown below:

```bash
# for Ubuntu/MacOS/Linux/etc (UNIX systems)
PROJECT={{project_name}} TOKEN={{token}} jet_bridge

# for Windows
set PROJECT={{Project Name}} && set TOKEN={{Token}} && jet_bridge
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**{Project Name} and {Token}** is automatically generated when you create a project.
{% endhint %}

This command creates a config if you run it for the first time.

After filling all required options you can now run Jet Bridge by executing the command once again:

```bash
jet_bridge
```

5.  Finish your project installation by opening this link in your browser \(usually, it opens automatically\):

```bash
http://localhost:8888/api/register/
```

**localhost** is your **Jet Bridge** HOST and **8888** is its PORT.

If you want to run Jet Bridge on a different host or port, read the instructions on the [Configuration page](jet-bridge-deployment/jet-admin/configuration#setting-up-your-configuration).
