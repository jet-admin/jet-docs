When it comes to analytics, sometimes you might want to dig deeper into your charts. 

Let's take as a reference a leaderboard chart with your customers. Say you displayed them all by the number of orders they made this month and willing to send a promocode to reward the top ones. You can do that by selecting that customer on the chart and clicking "Click to inspect". What it does is that it'll take you to this customer's record in a collection, so you can check their contact information and send in a promo.
