# Charts

Charts let you display and track global KPIs on the dashboard as well as provide at-a-glance performance insights. It's the fastest way to create analytical reports on your data. 

In Jet Admin, you can visualize your key metrics as any of the following chart widgets:

* Line chart
* Bar chart
* Pie Chart
* Doughnut Chart
* Counter
* List

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create them:

## Where can you add charts?

You can add charts in 2 places:

* In your **Dashboard** tab

## Query Builder

The Query Builder is a tool that allows you to create and edit complex charts using SQL.

### Schema Browser <a id="Schema-Browser"></a>

In the top right section of the query builder is the Schema Browser that lists all of your collections. To insert a collection into your SQL query, simply click on its name.

### Autocomplete <a id="Auto-Complete"></a>

The Autocomplete feature makes the whole process of creating complicated queries easier. When you start typing in a query, you'll immediately see a list of suggestions. Live autocomplete is turned on by default.

### Live Query Visualizations <a id="3-Add-Visualizations"></a>

As you're building a chart in the Query Builder, you can quickly display the result by clicking the "Chart Preview" button. It's a great way to check if you've made a mistake and correct it on the fly.
