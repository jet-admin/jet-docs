`Data` helps you to pull data from different [Resources](user-guide/integrations) and manage the Data. You can do different operations with your `Data`:

* Pull data from different Resources \(Database, Stripe, Zendesk, etc.\)
* Specify Column Types
* Define relations between collections

You handle the Data when you add a resource to your component. Collections are visualizations of the data that Jet gets from your resources.
