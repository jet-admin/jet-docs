## Copy and reset settings

To copy settings from a different project, go to the "Dangerous" section of the Settings page and scroll down to "Copy Interface Settings". All you have to do is choose a source project from a dropdown menu.

To reset settings to default, scroll down to "Reset Interface Settings" and choose what type of settings you'd like to reset.

**Please note that once you make changes or reset your settings to default, you won't be able to call it off.**
