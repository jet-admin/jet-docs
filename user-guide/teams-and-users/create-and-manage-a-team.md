You'll be taken to a new window, where you can type in the name of a new team and manage both project and collection permissions for this team.

## Manage your teams' permissions

Once a new team is created, it will appear in the "Teams" tab. You can always come back here to change your teams' permissions, delete a team, or create a new one.
