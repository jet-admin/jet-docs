# Related Record Fields

Records in some collections can be linked to each other. For instance, if you're managing a mobility company, your Drivers records will most certainly be linked to Rides records. 

In Jet Admin, you can add fields from one related record to another, so that you don't have to switch between those records and have all necessary information at-a-glance. 

## Adding a Record Field

To view and add related record fields to a given record, enter the Visual Builder mode by clicking the brush icon in the sidebar on the left ‚ü∂ Edit Record. In the appeared sidebar on the right, go to the Fields tab, where you'll see all available fields for this record. Related record fields will be marked as 'Related Model' and have a list of related fields.

To add any related record field, simply drag and drop it on the record.
