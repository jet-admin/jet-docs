# Field Widgets

### What are Field Widgets?

Field widgets are in other words different layout styles for your fields. By default, all fields from your database will be rendered in a text widget, but you can switch to a more appropriate one by entering the Visual Builder mode.

### Setting up a field widget

There are two ways of changing a widget of a specific field: 

1. Entering customization mode from the Collection view **\(1\)** and clicking the cog icon next to the field you would like to edit **\(2\)**. ****

You can customize this widget by specifying the format: will the numbers be displayed as integers or decimals, whether or not to allow negative numbers, whether or not to have a default number for this field.

Also, you can make the field read-only.
