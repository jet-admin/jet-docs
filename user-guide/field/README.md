# Fields

### What is a Field?

A field is a single piece of data, such as a _status_, _name_, or _price_, from a record in your collection.

All records of the same collection have the same fields. For instance, all restaraunt orders will have a specific _order type_, _customer_, _status_, _price_, etc.
