The menu is a key part of your app's interface where you can navigate between pages or projects, as well as access project settings, Visual Builder, help center, etc. Here's the structure of a menu in Jet:

1. **Account and project settings. Visual builder.** Here you can navigate to project settings and set up your account \(top\) or go to the Visual Builder to start building your pages \(bottom\).
2. **Help center.** Here you can get help from our technical support or open up an online chat with our specialists. You can also proceed to the documentation from here.
3. **Activity log & Home page.** Here you can navigate to the user activity log of the project to track changes \(bottom\) or quickly go to the home page \(middle\). As well as switch between your projects and environments.
4. **Navigate between pages.** Here you can navigate between pages and sections.
