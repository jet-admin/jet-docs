## What is a View?

A view is a way of portraying your data in the Jet Admin interface. There are four fully customizable views in Jet Admin:

## **Dashboard**

Dashboards are where you can create analytical reports on your application data. Build charts by running basic or SQL queries.

You can even build your own **Record View**, if youâ€™d like: add or remove columns, tabs, and sections, choose appropriate fields and related collections, and set up [**Actions**](https://docs.jetadmin.io/customization/flexaction) to be performed on a specific record or collection.

Keep related Records nicely organized in Collections.
