# Menu

### What is a menu?

A menu bar is a view where you can navigate through and open your database objects \(i.e. Views\) as well as access project settings, customization mode, help center, etc.

### Menu structure

The menu consists of 4 parts:

* **\(1\)** Current Project
* **\(2\)** System links
* **\(3\)** Side menu
* **\(4\)** Main menu

#### System links

This section consists of 3 buttons:

* **Help** Includes a Live Chat with support, Jet documentation, overview and home page links.
* **Customize Interface** Enables **Customization Mode**
* **Current User**  Includes Current Project and User settings, switching Jet skin and the logout link.

### Side and Main Menu

By default, all **Menu Items** are added to the **Main menu** except default system links, such as Dashboard, Conversations, and Search. But any **Menu Item** except Sections can be moved to the **Side menu**.

### Menu item types

* **Link** – an external link to particular URLs or link to some system pages inside **Jet Admin** \(Dashboard, Search, Conversations, etc.\)
* **Collection Link** – a link to Collection List page, you should choose collection
* **Section** – used for grouping menu items, more about it [here]()

### Customizing

Displaying menu items, grouping them into sections, their ordering and other UI can be customized directly in the **Jet Admin** interface.
