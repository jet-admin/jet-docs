# Dashboard

Dashboards are where you can create analytical reports on your application data. Build charts by running basic or SQL queries.

### Customize a dashboard

You can add, customize or move widgets on any of your Dashboards by entering the Visual Builder mode. Click on the "Customize Interface" button in the lower-left corner of the screen, then click "Update Dashboard".
