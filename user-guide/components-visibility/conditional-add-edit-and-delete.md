Allowing users to add, edit & delete records can be very powerful, but sometimes you want to restrict this to only certain Pages or to certain Teams/Users. With conditional add, edit & delete you can do this.

To do this, you need to go to the Permissions tab of the specific Team settings to set up granular access to each page in the application:

## Example 1: Make only certain pages visible \(Full Access/No Access\)

In case you need to configure access only to certain pages, you can set the No Access option for a specific page, in which case the user will not have access to this page by direct link, also it will not be visible to this user in the menu.

To do this, you need to go to the Permissions tab of the specific Team settings to set up granular access to each page in the application. Let's grant full access to only two pages: Admin Panel and Agent Task Management:

In this case, all users in that team will only see these two pages in the menu:

If the user goes to this page through a direct link he will see that screen:

{% hint style="info" %}
Now any user on this team will have full access to these pages.
{% endhint %}

## Example 2: Let users to read only access on the specific page

You can grant read-only access to any page. In this case, performing any action on that page \(unless your buttons are hidden based on visibility conditions\) will be prevented and the user will see an error message:
