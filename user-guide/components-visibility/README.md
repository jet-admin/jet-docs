Conditions help you implement condition-based editing and data access, and set the component visibility. 

Component Visibility rules allow you to create rules to determine whether a given component is visible \(and able to be interacted with\). For example, you can place several buttons in the same place and then create different visibility rules to determine which one appears for each User or Team in your app.

Allowing users to add, edit & delete records can be very powerful, but sometimes you want to restrict this to only certain Pages or to certain Teams/Users. With conditional add, edit & delete you can do this.
