# Visual Builder

## What is the Visual Builder?

The Visual Builder is an all-in-one editing feature that helps you edit, customize, and drag and drop interface elements in Jet ****Admin.

To start editing enter the customization mode by clicking on the "Customize Interface" button in the lower-left corner of your admin panel.

## **Views**

Jet Admin consists of the following **Views** that can be modified with the **Visual Builder**:

* **Dashboard**. Dashboards are where you can create analytical reports on your application data. Build charts by running basic or SQL queries.

All of the Views are fully customizable. You can even build your own **Record View**, if you’d like: add or remove columns, tabs, and sections, choose appropriate fields and related collections, and set up [**Actions**](https://docs.jetadmin.io/customization/flexaction) to be performed on a specific record or collection.

## **Widget Library**

The Visual Builder has a large library of **widgets** that includes:

### **Collection Widgets**

You can display your data in a familiar **Table** view or change the widget type in the settings. Effortlessly track your delivery team in the **Map** widget, write down the upcoming appointments in a **Calendar**, process orders in a **Kanban** board, or keep the pictures of your products in a **Gallery**.

### **Field Widgets**

**Fields** are single pieces of data about a specific **Record**. There are several types of **Field Types**: **Text**, **Checkbox**, and **Single**/**Multiple Select**. If you need to create a record of a product for sale, you can even insert an **Image** in one of the fields to differentiate this specific product from other records.

### **Chart Widgets**

These are great for displaying your KPI performance indicators like total revenue, the number of orders, etc. Depending on how you’d like to visualize your data, you can choose from **Line**, **Bar**, **Pie**, and **Doughnut** charts.
