## Invite by Email

In this case people will not be able to access your app unless they are invited to your project by an administrator, and then logged in with an Invite link sent to their email. 

You can also choose the team that the user automatically joins as soon as he/she signs up and accepts the invitation.

## Invite by Link

Invite by Link means that if anyone has the link to your app they can view it once they Sign Up.

You can also choose the team that the user automatically joins as soon as he/she signs up and accepts the invitation. All users signed up through that link will automatically get into your application and exactly the team you picked.
