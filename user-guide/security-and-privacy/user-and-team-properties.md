The User and Team properties are useful for the scopes feature: they allow you to group users \(not teams\) and control the data they can see.

## User & Team Properties

To create a property for a Team or User, you need to go into the settings for the specific Team or User in your application, as shown below:

Note that it is important to create User & Team Properties with the same key value so that you can refer to this property via formulas for all properties at once.
{% endhint %}
