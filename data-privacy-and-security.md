## **Where is my data stored, and is it secure?**

Yes, your data is secure and is always stored by you. We provide Jet Bridge that makes our architecture  secure. Jet Bridge is a free and open**-**source app that **generates an API** and proxies the requests to databases and business apps. We don‚Äôt collect or host your private data on our side. Jet encrypts all data and credentials that go through our servers using an HTTPS connection.

Host Jet Bridge on your servers. You can place it behind your VPN, in your own VPC. We won‚Äôt get access to your data, however, you will still receive interfaces updates normally.

If your infrastructure doesn't have access to the internet, you can use on-premise on your own servers and block all network connections. You can place it behind your VPN, in your own VPC.

## Incident Recovery <a id="incident-recovery"></a>

To prevent bad consequences for your business, Jet Admin automatically creates a backup of your interface, so you can always restore it in case of an incident. Simply push the ‚ÄúRecover‚Äù button at the top right corner of your screen and select what you would like to backup.

## DMZ <a id="dmz"></a>

Since Jet Admin doesn‚Äôt require access to your data, you are free to host your admin‚Äôs API under DMZ or VPN network. Once you do that, your admin panel will be separated from your public network, leaving no chance for malicious attacks or remote rooting. This might be on a checklist for some large healthcare and financial companies that can be held liable for clients‚Äô personal information. In most cases though, it is not a necessity.

## IP Whitelisting <a id="ip-whitelisting"></a>

When your company grows to an enterprise, it is especially hard to track how many people end up having access to your data. Not to be dramatic, but there is always a possibility for an insider attack. Thanks to the IP Whitelisting feature, you can create a list of the IP addresses you trust to interact with your Jet admin panel.
